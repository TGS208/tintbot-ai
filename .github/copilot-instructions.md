## 🛠️ Development Best Practices

git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "New integration architecture"

# Feature branch workflow
git checkout -b feature/acuity-integration
git checkout -b fix/sms-notification-bug
```

**Testing Strategy:**
```javascript
// Unit tests for core functions
describe('Lead Scoring', () => {
  test('High quality lead scores 80+', () => {
    const lead = {
      hasPhone: true,
      hasEmail: true,
      vehicleInfo: { make: 'BMW', model: 'X5' },
      readyToBook: true
    }
    expect(calculateLeadScore(lead)).toBeGreaterThan(80)
  })
})

// Integration tests for workflows
describe('Booking Flow', () => {
  test('Complete booking triggers all integrations', async () => {
    const result = await processBooking(mockLeadData)
    expect(result.acuityAppointment).toBeDefined()
    expect(result.squareInvoice).toBeDefined()
    expect(result.smsConfirmation).toBe('sent')
  })
})
```

**Monitoring & Logging:**
```javascript
// Structured logging
const winston = require('winston')

logger.info('Lead captured', {
  leadId: lead.id,
  source: lead.source,
  score: lead.score,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})

// Error tracking
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: { component: 'automation' },
