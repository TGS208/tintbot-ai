## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails on Netlify

**Check Build Log:**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Deploys
2. Click on the failed deploy
3. Review the build log

**Common Issues:**

**Issue: Node version mismatch**
- ✅ Already Fixed: `netlify.toml` specifies Node 20

**Issue: Dependencies not installed**
- ✅ Already Fixed: `package.json` is committed

**Issue: Build command not found**
- ✅ Already Fixed: Build scripts in `package.json`

**Issue: Dist directory empty**
- ✅ Already Fixed: Build script generates all files

### If Site is Blank After Deployment

1. **Check Browser Console** for errors
2. **Verify CDN Resources Load** (React, Tailwind, etc.)
3. **Check Redirects** - Should have `/* /index.html 200`
4. **Clear Browser Cache** and hard refresh

### If Forms Don't Work

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard → Forms**
2. **Verify form attributes** (`data-netlify="true"`)
3. **Check hidden form** is in HTML (for detection)
4. **Test with simple HTML form** first
